# C O N T R I B U T I N G

contributions are really welcome from anyone. the focus of the zine is prose / poetry / art / feelings / honesty so if you have anything that fits that criteria we would love to publish it so much.

to contribute to the zine just create a PR with your page in whatever format in the directory for the current issue. someone will merge it and get it into the next print run.
